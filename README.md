This is a fork by me for the use in a personal project, I plan on actively updating it and keeping up with version changes and bug fixes. Just keep in mind that some of the features **will not** be present, as my main focus point lays on updating the features I primarily use (other features may also be updated), but my priority doesn't lay on the features I don't actively need.
